## Introduction

Data privacy is more important than ever. With the abundance of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT available for public use, personal and sensitive information can easily be shared unknowingly. Removing data is a complex challenge once fed into these models, making proactive data protection essential.


## The Risks of Exposing Sensitive Data


Many users input personal, financial, or confidential information into LLMs without considering the implications. This data can include:


- Personal Identifiable Information (PII) includes addresses, phone numbers, and social security numbers.


- Financial details like credit card numbers and banking information.


- Proprietary business information should remain confidential.


Even though many AI providers implement safeguards, no system is foolproof. Accidental data leaks or misuse can have serious consequences, from identity theft to corporate espionage.


## The Challenge of Removing Data from LLMs


Unlike traditional databases, where deleting records is straightforward, removing data from an LLM is far more complicated. Once a model is trained on data, it doesn’t “store” it in a conventional way but absorbs patterns and relationships, making it nearly impossible to extract specific details from this learned knowledge. Even if companies attempt to filter out sensitive data, there’s no easy way to ensure that fragments don’t persist in some form. Additionally, if users share private information in prompts, LLMs can unintentionally reinforce and regurgitate these details in future responses. Because of these challenges, prevention is always better than cure.


## How Protection Helps Safeguard Your Data


Promptection addresses this issue by detecting and anonymising sensitive information before it reaches an LLM. With features like:


1. Automatic detection of PII, credit card numbers, and more.


2. Placeholder replacement to prevent unintentional data leaks.


3. A popup for transparency on modified inputs.


4. Site-specific activation, ensuring control over when it’s used.


By integrating <span class="custom-link">[Promptection](https://cedricleung.ca/#/promptection)</span> users can take control of their data privacy without relying solely on external safeguards. Data privacy should never be an afterthought. Given the difficulty of removing sensitive data from LLMs, the best approach is to prevent unnecessary exposure in the first place. Tools like Promptection empower users to maintain control over their information, making the digital world safer for everyone.
