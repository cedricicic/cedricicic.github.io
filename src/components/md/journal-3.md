## Building my first web scraper

Aside from being a full-time math student, I also sell clothes for extra pocket change. Over time, I’ve noticed that Grailed, while being an incredible platform for the fashion resale community, lacks detailed metrics and often presents data in a way that isn’t very user-friendly.


This observation led me to create Holy Grailed, a tool designed to help sellers and buyers reach agreements more quickly and efficiently.


## What is Holy Grailed?


Holy Grailed is a web scraper application that accepts an active Grailed listing URL, scrapes the top 30 related listings, and performs an in-depth analysis in about 20 seconds. The goal is to provide more visualisable insights, empowering users to make quicker and more transparent pricing decisions.


## Key Features:


1. Scrapes Top 30 Related Listings: Provides a comprehensive overview of similar items.


2. Real-Time Analysis: Delivers data-driven insights to assist in pricing and decision-making.


3. User-Centric Visuals: Helps sellers better understand market trends and price their items competitively.


## Technical Challenges:


Currently, the script operates with headless: false, meaning the browser visibly opens during scraping. I’m working on making it headless for better efficiency and easier deployment. If you have experience with Puppeteer or deploying web scrapers, I would love your advice on making this script more robust. <3


## A Weekend Demo:


This project started as a quick weekend demo to showcase how additional seller and buyer insights could benefit Grailed's platform. It’s a fun side project and is not intended for commercial use. Please use it responsibly and avoid overloading Grailed’s system.
