        <p className="about-description">
          Ever since I was young, I’ve been captivated by concepts, complex
          thoughts, and patterns—things I could see but often struggled to
          articulate. Ideas have always lingered in my mind, some small, some
          profound. It reminds me of what David Lynch said
          about ideas being like fish, “beautiful and abstract,” just waiting to
          be caught. But I didn’t just want to catch them; I wanted to preserve
          and share their beauty.
          <br />
          <br />
          That drew me to mathematics and computer science at the University of
          Waterloo. If I couldn’t express my ideas through filmmaking or words,
          maybe I could do it with code and equations instead. Data
          visualization became my way of showing people exactly what I saw in my
          head—making the abstract tangible.
          <br />
          <br />
          Through this journey, I aim to inspire others to see the beauty in
          abstract ideas and explore the connections between art, data, and
          storytelling. If you wish to follow my journey, please click{" "}
